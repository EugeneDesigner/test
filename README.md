# Test

Here is the test task you sent me before. Sorry for the little delay, as I had a problem with using Backbone as a foundation for React views. The last problem I did not deal with is the update of the student database with the chosen student. The problem is very solvable, but I need more time and more info to do that.Even though I had the base knowledge of Backbone, it transformed in the end into a guessing game - not a good trait for a programming process. I will have time in the beginning of the next week to look again at the problem - I want to dig deep into Backbone during the weekend. I would also be thankful if you could help me in any way with your piece of advice - I would be very thankful for that, as learning is the only way to move forward

Apart from that, I did everything according to instructions. Especially, it was very tricky to create calendar and maintain time slots - I spent some time dealing with all the peculiarities of potential user experience and writing code.

I also wanted to thank you with this test task - it was very interesting and challenging. No matter what awaits me further, I liked the experience I had, as I was able to learn a lot while coding and dealing with all the pitfalls.
